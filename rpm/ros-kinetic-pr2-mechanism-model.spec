%description
This package contains the robot model that is used by the realtime controllers
inside controller manager. This robot model focuses on controlling the robot
mechanism in a realtime control loop, and therefore it only contains the
components of a robot that are relevant in realtime: the robot joints (with
encoders, transmisisons and actuators) and the kinematic/dynamic model of the
robot. The pr2_mechanism_model package is well tested and is released with a
stable API.
